## FAQs

### Why PDI is not working?

Many reasons:

 - Your computer has JRE not JDK
 - Your computer has JDK v8 not v9
 - Your computer have several java virtual machines (7, 8 and/or 9).
 - PDI is not in the right folder
 - PDI has not been extracted from the zip file.
 
### How to solve the problem?

  - [Mac]: In the applications folder
  - [Windows]: In C:/

We must uninstall all JRE, JDK from our system and install the right JDK version.
