The topic of this session is **Data Modelling**. This repository includes the content discuss in class:

  - Schemas
  - Videos

## How to use this content

  - Download the folder and don't modified the structure
  - Required Software:
	  - MySQL
	  - MySQL Workbench
  - All schemas have been created with MySQL Workbench.
  
## MySQL Workbench flags 

When creating attibutes with MSQL Workbench we can use different flags:

  - PK - Primary Key
  - NN - Not Null
  - BIN - Binary (stores data as binary strings. There is no character set so sorting and comparison is based on the numeric values of the bytes in the values.)
  - UN - Unsigned (non-negative numbers only. so if the range is -500 to 500, instead its 0 - 1000, the range is the same but it starts at 0)
  - UQ - Create/remove Unique Key
  - ZF - Zero-Filled (if the length is 5 like INT(5) then every field is filled with 0’s to the 5th value. 12 = 00012, 400 = 00400, etc. )
  - AI - Auto Increment
  - G - Generated column. i.e. value generated by a formula based on the other columns.

## FAQs

If you forget your MySQL password or don't know how to change MySQL root password, follow these steps.

### Windows

Use the installer (that you can find in control panel > uninstall programs) to restore your MySQL installation.

### Mac

**Option 1**

Open terminal and follow these steps

 - Stop MySQL:

``` 
sudo /usr/local/mysql/support-files/mysql.server stop
``` 

  - Restart mysql with the option "skip grants tables":

``` 
sudo /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tables
``` 

  - Update the "root" user password:

``` 
UPDATE USER SET AUTHENTICATION_STRING=password('NewPassword') WHERE user='root'
``` 

 - Flush privileges

``` 
FLUSH PRIVILEGES
``` 

**Option 2**

In this link you will find the steps (for every OS): http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/resetting-permissions.html. 

**Option 3**

Last but not least. If the previous options are not working, you can uninstall MySQL and completely remove it from your Mac:

  - Open a terminal window
  - Write the following instructions (one by one):

```  
sudo rm /usr/local/mysql
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/mysql*
sudo rm -rf /Library/StartupItems/MySQLCOM
sudo rm -rf /Library/PreferencePanes/My*
sudo rm -rf ~/Library/PreferencePanes/My*
sudo rm -rf /Library/Receipts/mysql*
sudo rm -rf /Library/Receipts/MySQL*
sudo rm -rf /private/var/db/receipts/*mysql*
``` 

After this, you need to install again MySQL and keep the auto-generated password. Then:

 - Start the database (from the system preferences).
 - Open MySQL Workbench and create a connection. 
 - It will ask for the generated password. After that a new window will appear to propose a new password. Choose one easy to remember. After this you will be able to enter to the server with your new password.
