## MySQL Workbench flags 

When creating attibutes with MSQL Workbench we can use different flags:

  - PK - Primary Key
  - NN - Not Null
  - BIN - Binary (stores data as binary strings. There is no character set so sorting and comparison is based on the numeric values of the bytes in the values.)
  - UN - Unsigned (non-negative numbers only. so if the range is -500 to 500, instead its 0 - 1000, the range is the same but it starts at 0)
  - UQ - Create/remove Unique Key
  - ZF - Zero-Filled (if the length is 5 like INT(5) then every field is filled with 0’s to the 5th value. 12 = 00012, 400 = 00400, etc. )
  - AI - Auto Increment
  - G - Generated column. i.e. value generated by a formula based on the other columns.
